# Sorting_Algorithms_Searching_Algorithms

In this repo, we have tried implementation of basic searching and sorting algorithms written in javascript.

1. Bubble Sort - The idea behind bubble sort is that every pair of adjacent values is compared, and then the two values swap positions if the first value is greater than the second. This way during each pass through the array, the largest value “bubbles up” to the top, and after each pass the elements furthest to the right are in the correct order.
Time Complexity - O(n^2)

2. Selection sort- This is called selection sort since this repeatedly selects the smallest element from the array.
Time complexity- O(n^2)

3. Insertion sort - Remove an element from the input data and insert it into its right position in the list being sorted. Its is an in-place sorting.
Time complexity - O(n^2)

4. Merge Sort - it uses the concept of divide and conquer to sort a list of elements. It will divide the bigger problem into smaller problems and then solve each of the small problems in order to solve the bigger problem that we started out with.
Time Complexity - O(nlogn)

5. Quick Sort - Quick Sort algorithm follows Divide and Conquer approach. It divides elements into smaller parts based on some condition and performing the sort operations on those divided smaller parts.
Time Complexity- O(nlogn)

6. Linear Search is a searching algorithm that we can use to search an element in array. We search an element by traversing the array and checking each element with the current index element. We return the index of the element, if found.
Time complexity = O(n)

7. Binary Search - This is the searching algorithm that uses the concept of divide and conquer to find an element in a sorted array.
Time Complexity - O(logn)
